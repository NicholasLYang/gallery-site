      <h1> About </h1>
      <p>
        Superficial Seamlessness is a project dedicated to unearthing the hidden
        forces behind the ostensibly seamless facades of tech companies. Whether
        it's the hidden labor behind Amazon's shipping empire, or the massive
        amounts of data collection that underpin Google's ecosystem,
        seamlessness entices the customer while obscuring the true cost of the
        corporation's actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have chosen to cover 4 basic forces behind seamlessness: labor, data,
        funding and addiction. This is not a complete list and there certainly
        exist other factors, but we believe these four are currently the most
        crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each force has a corresponding case study in the form of a company. For
        labor; Amazon. Data; Google. Funding; WeWork. Addiction; Facebook. These
        companies were chosen because while each company features all 4 forces
        to some extent, the representative company for a given force demonstrates
        the force to a dramatic (and therefore educational) extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each force has a separate exhibit which includes art that juxtaposes the
        company's advertising with talks given by various experts and critics of
        the company. Furthermore, we have written portions which have also been
        added to this site on each company's page.
