      Amazon provides seamlessness through its fast and almost effortless
      delivery service. Customers have the illusion that they can order
      almost anything and it will be delivered to their doorstep, almost
      by magic.
    </p>
      <p>
        However, behind the scenes Amazon relies on massive quantities of
        labor along with extremely vicious mandates on warehouse workers'
        efficiency and speed.
