        Facebook provides an interesting example of how seamlessness is immanent
        to the company's business model. Namely, Facebook relies on an utterly
        seamless experience in their web, mobile and desktop applications to
        foster addiction.

        The chief innovation in this front is the News Feed feature. By replacing
        a chronological list of posts with an opaque, neverending feed, Facebook
        appears to be providing a constant stream of information and stimuli.
        Even when there isn't enough content from the user's friends, the feed
        uses sponsored or "recommended" content, along with recycled older posts
        to give the illusion of more.
      </p>

        To create these innovations, Facebook has invested loads of money into
        web development. These investments allow for slicker, smoother and
        ultimately more addictive experiences.
