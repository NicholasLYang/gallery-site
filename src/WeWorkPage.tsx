        WeWork is a company that specializes in providing coworking spaces for
        companies and individuals. WeWork relied on massive amounts of funding
        from SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, to grow rapidly, acquiring
        gigantic swaths of property. WeWork attempted to use this growth to
        cultivate a seamless experience for their customers: a global working
        space available anywhere and everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the public caught on to WeWork's lack of profitability and its
        overall issues with business model, strategy and leadership. Therefore,
        its valuation tumbled from 47 billion dollars to 10 billion.

        In this exhibit, we will explore how WeWork managed to raise
        astronomical sums of money, namely 12.8 billion dollars, and how
        it failed to capitalize upon this massive sum.
